      <ul>
        <li>In 1956 C.C. Paterson calculated the age of the Earth
           - 4.55 billion years, a value which remained
            largely unchanged to this day. Before Patterson's work the age of the Earth was estimated
            to be approximately 3.3 billion years.
        </li>

          In his research Paterson used uraniumâ€“lead dating, 
          which made him realise the difficulties connected to
          lead contamination of samples. This lead him to create
          one of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom" target="_blank">cleanrooms</a> ever.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>C.C. Paterson's second important discovery was that humans were responsible for the lead contamination
          of the environment on the massive scale. The agent responsible for that was mainly a gasoline additive - tetraethyllead.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          C.C. Paterson dedicated the rest of his carrer for advocating 
          the reduction of environmental lead contamination based 
          on scientfic evidence. In was mainly his relentless efforts that eventually lead to the worldwide ban of leaded gasoline.
